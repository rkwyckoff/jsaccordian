Accordian Project--Feb 11, 2017, Kurt Wyckoff
1)used jquery functions to add and remove classes dynamically in CSS so that when one of three documents is in "open state", the other two are closed.  
Started off with all docs being in "closed " class, then used the jQuery scripts to add class of "open" when target document was clicked, setting a "delay" in the opening to create an "accordian " effect.  Then when another document was clicked, the currently open doc went to a closed state (removed class of "open" dynamically) and the clicked doc slid up with a delay. (added class of "open") Very Cool!
